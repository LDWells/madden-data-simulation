## Description

EA Sports has been developing and selling the Madden NFL simulation game for about 40 years, with a major stated goal of making the game as realistic as possible. Prior research has shown that league-wide simulations using the Madden Franchise mode can be used to reliably predict game outcomes, point spreads, and other team-wide metrics of play. In fact, during the 2022-2023 season, simulating actual NFL games using the Madden 22 video game was shown to "beat Draftkings" in certain scenarios. 

Given these positive results, researchers have used the Madden 23 video game to  simulate the seasonâ€™s actual games and gather data. The primary objective was to investigate on-field performance for the situation involving Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson who was suspended for 11 games in the 2022 NFL season and fined $5M for violating the NFL's personal-conduct policy. The Cleveland Browns suffered negative impacts on their organizational reputation when they announced a record setting contract for Watson while he was under investigation, and we were interested in understanding if this was "worth it" from the perspective of the football outcomes and other metrics. Therefore, data was gathered using the Madden Franchise mode for scenarios involving: full-season suspension of Watson, no suspension of Watson, the 11 game suspension that actually happened, and a shorter 6-game suspension that was initially proposed by the NFL.

The goal of this project is to (1) import and process data from the actual NFL 2022-2023 season to use as a comparison with the data extracted from Madden 23; (2) compare and validate the veracity of the Madden 23 simulations with the actual data, including determination of calibration biases; (3) use the calibration to evaluate the likely impact on the Cleveland Browns football team game outcomes and other football metrics; and (4) use financial data that is available to determine the dollar impact of the different scenarios on the Cleveland Browns organization.
